# Thread-Demo

Basic program to demonstrate the concept of "Multi-Threading" in JAVA

* By extending the Thread Class and overriding the run()
```
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
   
     // <Defining A Thread>
     // We have to over-ride the run method 
     // It means run method is already availabe in Thread Class
     // <Job Of Thread>
     
   }
}
```
